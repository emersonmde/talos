# Phase 12 Networking and SSH

Phase 12 starts with source-only RP1 Ethernet research. The accepted Phase 11
frontier allows source inventory and design selection, but it does not accept
Ethernet implementation, packet I/O, live DMA, networking, sockets, or SSH.

## RP1 Ethernet Source Inventory

phase12-rp1-ethernet-source-inventory-20260609 accepts the source-backed RP1
Ethernet inventory for Milestone 12.1. Retained and fetched Raspberry Pi Linux
sources identify `rp1_eth` as `raspberrypi,rp1-gem` / `cdns,macb` at RP1 bus
`0xc0_40100000`, with source CPU physical translation `0x1f_0010_0000`,
`RP1_INT_ETH`, clocks `RP1_CLK_SYS`, `RP1_CLK_ETH_TSU`, and `RP1_CLK_ETH`,
`phy-mode = "rgmii-id"`, and Pi 5 PHY reset through RP1 GPIO32.

The inventory also accepts that the Linux Cadence MACB/GEM path depends on DMA
descriptor rings, packet buffers, MDIO/PHY reset, phylink, clocks, interrupts,
and completion handling. Talos keeps those as prerequisites, not accepted
runtime behavior.

## Retained Boundaries

The Phase 12.1 inventory does not accept broad RP1 Ethernet MMIO readiness,
descriptor-ring ownership, RP1 DMA channel ownership, transfer completion,
interrupt completion, GPIO32 PHY reset ownership, clock/reset ownership, packet
I/O, network stack behavior, sockets, SSH, or Phase 12.2 work. The next
bounded step is a path-selection ADR/design note before any implementation.

## Path Selection ADR

phase12-rp1-ethernet-path-adr-20260609 selects the direct RP1 Cadence GEM path
as the Phase 12.1 target, but only after staged hardware-substrate proofs. The
decision rejects immediate driver work because the accepted Linux MACB/GEM
source path depends on unaccepted Ethernet MMIO, DMA descriptors and packet
buffers, ring-base programming, MDIO/PHY reset, clocks, interrupts, and
completion handling.

The ADR defers no_std driver reuse until Talos proves the required hardware and
driver substrate boundaries. It also defers a simpler non-RP1 transport because
that would not retire the explicit RP1 Ethernet research unknowns. The next
program step requires supervisor planning for a bounded read-only RP1
GEM/Ethernet MMIO source-contract diagnostic with paired no-Ethernet/no-MMIO
control evidence. No Ethernet implementation, packet I/O, network stack,
sockets, SSH, live DMA, descriptor rings, or Phase 12.2 work is accepted by
the ADR.

## GEM MID Source Contract

phase12-rp1-ethernet-gem-mid-source-contract-20260609 accepts the source-only
contract for the first bounded GEM visibility diagnostic. The exact future
candidate target is MACB_MID at offset 0x00fc from rp1_eth, producing source
RP1 bus address 0xc0_401000fc and source-translated CPU physical address
0x1f001000fc. The contract is limited to a 32-bit little-endian volatile load
in a future diagnostic, paired with a no-Ethernet/no-MMIO control report that
withholds the Ethernet MMIO target.

Retained Raspberry Pi Linux source evidence defines the rp1_eth base at
0xc0_40100000, MACB_MID at 0x00fc, and the IDNUM and REV fields inside MID.
This remains source evidence only: live broad RP1 Ethernet MMIO readiness, RP1
MMIO writes, DMA, descriptor rings, interrupts, clock/reset ownership, PHY
reset ownership, packet I/O, networking, sockets, SSH, and Phase 12.2 remain
unaccepted.

## GEM MID Diagnostic Core

phase12-rp1-ethernet-gem-mid-diagnostic-core-20260609 accepts the local/static
report construction for the GEM MID source contract. The candidate report
preserves the accepted rp1_eth/MACB_MID target, source evidence, rejected
claims, retained risks, and hardware-proof boundary classification. The paired
control uses the same report contract while withholding Ethernet MMIO target
fields and carrying no-ethernet-no-mmio-rp1-ethernet-gem-mid-control.

The diagnostic core is not a hardware proof. Live GEM visibility, broad
Ethernet MMIO readiness, RP1 MMIO/DMA programming, descriptors, interrupts,
clock/reset ownership, PHY reset ownership, packet I/O, networking, sockets,
SSH, and Phase 12.2 remain unaccepted until later explicit tasks.

## GEM MID Diagnostic Closeout

phase12-rp1-ethernet-gem-mid-diagnostic-closeout-20260609 closes the
local/static GEM MID report frontier before hardware publication. The
checkpoint reconciles the accepted source contract and diagnostic core,
retains the no-Ethernet/no-MMIO paired control boundary, and selects the
queued serialized Pi 5 visibility/control proof as the next bounded step.

The closeout does not accept live GEM visibility, broad Ethernet MMIO
readiness, Ethernet driver readiness, RP1 MMIO/DMA programming, descriptor
rings, interrupt completion, clock/reset ownership, PHY reset ownership,
packet I/O, networking, sockets, SSH, Phase 12.2, or a phase transition.

## GEM MID Pi 5 Proof

phase12-rp1-ethernet-gem-mid-pi5-proof-20260609 accepts the serialized Pi 5
visibility/control proof as a precise blocker. The no-Ethernet/no-MMIO
control proved the serial reporting path without constructing the Ethernet
MMIO target. The candidate reached the bounded `MACB_MID` read at CPU physical
`0x1f001000fc`, but the read returned `raw=0xdeaddead`, classified as
`rp1-ethernet-gem-mid-blocked-address-decode-sentinel`.

This is not live GEM visibility and does not accept broad Ethernet MMIO
readiness. It keeps Ethernet driver readiness, RP1 MMIO/DMA programming,
descriptor rings, transfer completion, interrupt completion, clock/reset
ownership, PHY reset ownership, packet I/O, networking, sockets, SSH, Phase
12.2, and phase transition work rejected. The next step requires supervisor
planning around the GEM MID address-decode or bridge-enable dependency.

## GEM MID Blocker Reconciliation

phase12-rp1-ethernet-gem-mid-blocker-reconciliation-20260610 refines the
`0xdeaddead` result as
`rp1-ethernet-gem-mid-retained-0x1f-window-sentinel`. Retained source evidence
still supports the source translation to `0x1f001000fc`; the stronger clue is
that Phase 11 had already retained `0xdeaddead` through the translated
`0x1f` RP1 aperture while observed `0x1c` RP1 sysinfo/clock/GPIO reads were
visible.

The selected next discriminator is a local/static same-run report shape:
observed RP1 `SYSINFO_CHIP_ID` at `0x1c00000000` as the positive control plus
`MACB_MID` at `0x1f001000fc`, with a paired no-MMIO/no-Ethernet control.
This still rejects live GEM visibility, broad Ethernet MMIO readiness, Ethernet
driver readiness, packet I/O, DMA, interrupts, clock/reset ownership, PHY reset
ownership, networking, sockets, SSH, Phase 12.2, and phase transition work.

## GEM MID Decode Discriminator Core

phase12-rp1-ethernet-gem-mid-decode-discriminator-core-20260610 accepts only
the local/static report construction for that changed discriminator. The
candidate report requires the same-run observed RP1 `SYSINFO_CHIP_ID`
positive-control target at `0x1c00000000`, expected value `0x20001927`, plus
the source-backed `MACB_MID` target at `0x1f001000fc`. The paired control uses
the same report contract but constructs neither the observed RP1 target nor
the Ethernet MMIO target.

This core does not run hardware or accept live GEM visibility. It only makes a
later hardware proof mechanically different from the accepted GEM MID-only
proof. Ethernet driver readiness, broad Ethernet MMIO readiness, RP1 MMIO/DMA
programming, descriptor rings, interrupts, clock/reset ownership, PHY reset
ownership, packet I/O, networking, sockets, SSH, Phase 12.2, and phase
transition work remain unaccepted.

## GEM MID Decode Discriminator Closeout

phase12-rp1-ethernet-gem-mid-decode-discriminator-closeout-20260610 closes the
local/static discriminator checkpoint and selects the serialized Pi 5 proof as
the next bounded task. The selected candidate archive must capture the same-run
observed RP1 `SYSINFO_CHIP_ID` positive-control load at `0x1c00000000`
alongside the translated `MACB_MID` target at `0x1f001000fc`. The paired
control must use the same reporting path while constructing neither observed
RP1 nor Ethernet MMIO targets.

The closeout only authorizes a later serialized proof with hardwareTestLock
ownership, candidate/control identity, fresh serial cursor, TFTP delta, serial
transcript, final pre-restore identity, restore proof, and task-owned
classification/evidence JSON. It does not accept live GEM visibility, broad
Ethernet MMIO readiness, Ethernet driver readiness, RP1 MMIO/DMA programming,
descriptor rings, interrupts, clock/reset ownership, PHY reset ownership,
packet I/O, networking, sockets, SSH, Phase 12.2, or a phase transition.
